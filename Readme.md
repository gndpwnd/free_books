### Convert PDF to Audio Book

I use [this script](https://gist.github.com/gndpwnd/cfaa8ee83c24c01c2da7a3ebf44ea97f) to convert PDFs to TXT files. Essentially generate a list of sentences, then a bit of manual tweaking of the TXT file to help normalize the workload for the next tool.

I then use [this site](https://audio.online-convert.com/convert/txt-to-mp3) to convert the TXT files into an audible MP3 file.

Additionally, while it is very limited for free use, [Zamazar](https://zazmar.com) provides an alternative for the conversion of TXT to MP3.
